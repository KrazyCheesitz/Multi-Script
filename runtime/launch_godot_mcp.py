"""Multi-Script Godot MCP launcher.

Starts the pinned Godot MCP server (``@coding-solo/godot-mcp``) over stdio for the
Multi-Script bridge.

Two things matter here and are easy to get wrong:

1. **stdout belongs to the MCP protocol.** A stdio MCP server speaks JSON-RPC on
   stdout, so this launcher must NEVER print anything there - a stray line
   corrupts the handshake and the bridge reports a dead server with no useful
   error. Every diagnostic below therefore goes to stderr only, and there is a
   regression test that asserts stdout stays empty.

2. **The Godot editor path.** The Godot MCP needs to know where the Godot binary
   is (``GODOT_PATH``). If the user has not set it, the server starts but every
   project call fails with an opaque error. So we look for the binary in the
   places Godot actually installs itself, set ``GODOT_PATH`` when we find it, and
   say clearly on stderr what we found or what to set when we do not.

Environment overrides:
  ZS_NPX_PATH            explicit path to npx (npm/npx not on PATH)
  ZS_GODOT_MCP_VERSION   pin a different @coding-solo/godot-mcp version
  ZS_GODOT_PATH          explicit Godot binary (wins over auto-detection)
  GODOT_PATH             the variable the server itself reads (also honoured)
