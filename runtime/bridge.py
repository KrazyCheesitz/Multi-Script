#  Multi-Script Bridge
#  Local WebSocket <-> Roblox Studio MCP server.
#  The browser extension talks to this over ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>.
#
#  What this bridge exposes to Kimi (aggregated into one tools/list):
#    - Every MCP server declared in config.json (by default: roblox), each
#      spawned as a stdio child and routed by tool name.
#
#  Design goals (robustness first):
#   - Each MCP stdio process is read by ONE dedicated thread; responses are
#     matched by JSON-RPC id (no "read the next line and hope" races).
#   - stderr is drained so a child never blocks on a full pipe.
#   - A dead server is auto-restarted and the failing call retried once.
#   - Tool calls are locked PER SERVER, so a slow server never blocks another.
#   - Every call ALWAYS produces a reply: a result OR a structured error.
#     Nothing ever hangs the agentic loop silently.

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  ENGINE-NATIVE TOOL FACADE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The advisory tools above tell the model WHAT to do. These actually DO it: each
# one is a thin, dialect-correct wrapper that composes the live native MCP tools
# of a specific engine into one meaningful operation, then reads back the result
# to prove it happened.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The engines do not share a vocabulary, and each has a habitual failure:
#
#   * Roblox Studio requires `studio_id` on every place-scoped call, so with two
#     Studios open a model that omits it is rejected - the "invalid parameters:
#     parameters.studio_id is required" spam reported live.
#   * Unity is ACTION-DISPATCH: `manage_scene` takes `action: "get_hierarchy"`.
#     A model that writes {"command":"get_hierarchy"} gets "unknown command".
#   * Godot requires `projectPath` (camelCase, absolute, the FOLDER holding
#     project.godot) on almost everything; `list_projects` is the lone exception
#     and takes `directory`.
#   * Blender is code-execution based, so the failure is a JSON-escape bug in a
#     long Python string rather than a wrong name.
#
# A model reading prose about four dialects will still get one wrong. It will not
# get a single call with one obvious name and honest parameters wrong. So each
# facade tool below advertises only ENGINE-NEUTRAL parameters, translates them to
# the right dialect internally, and returns a normalised result envelope with the
# exact native calls it issued. Nothing is invented: every tool name it can emit
# is read from the engine's live advertised catalogue at call time, and it fails
# loudly when the engine does not advertise what it needs.

#    means a Studio app IS connected, BUT note its entry stays present (active:true)
#    even when no place is open - only its "name" goes null. So presence != usable.
#  - get_studio_state: tells whether a PLACE is actually loaded. With a place open
#    it returns "Available DataModels: ..."; with the Studio on the home screen (or
#    the active place closed) it returns "...doesn't have a place opened / previously
#    active Studio has disconnected". That is the authoritative "place loaded" signal
