// core/engines.js - native-tool knowledge for every engine EXCEPT Roblox Studio.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Roblox Studio's MCP exposes one flat tool per action, so the JSON transport
// alone is enough: {"command":"execute_luau","params":{...}}. The other engines
// do not look like that, and the difference - not the transport - is what makes
// them "not work properly":
//
//   * Unity MCP is ACTION-DISPATCH. There is no `get_hierarchy` tool; there is
//     `manage_scene` with an `action` string. A model that has just learned
//     Roblox's shape writes {"command":"get_hierarchy"} and gets "unknown
//     command". This is the single most common Unity failure, and resolveAction
//     below repairs it automatically.
//   * Godot MCP is flat BUT camelCase with `projectPath` required everywhere, and
//     `list_projects` takes `directory` instead. `path`, `project_path` and
//     `projectDir` all fail.
//   * Blender MCP is code-execution based, so the failure mode is a JSON-escape
//     bug inside a long code string, not a wrong tool name.
//
// So the TRANSPORT stays plain JSON everywhere (MCP itself is JSON-RPC, and every
// tool takes JSON-schema'd params - a second wire format would only add parser
// surface and split the camouflage/parse-error handling). What changes per engine
// is the VOCABULARY: the exact tool names, the required parameter spellings, the
// action-dispatch indirection, and the curated gotchas.
//
// PURITY: no DOM, no chrome.*, no timers. Everything here is data + pure
// functions so it is unit-testable in plain node (tests/test_engine_tool_layer.js).
//
// PROVENANCE - how each fact below was established, so nothing is a guess:
//   [schema]  read out of the shipped package build (Godot 0.1.1, read from the
//             published tarball's build/index.js inputSchema blocks)
//   [ref]     read out of the vendored upstream reference in vendor/
//   [live]    recorded from an actual observed failure in this codebase
// If a fact cannot be attributed, it is not here.

  // ── Roblox Studio: the `studio_id` contract ──────────────────────────────

  //   [roblox] stderr: WARN ... sent a request without studio_id but multiple studios are connected
  //
  // The last line is the whole reason this bug is INTERMITTENT rather than total:
  // the proxy SILENTLY auto-selects a Studio when exactly ONE is attached, so the
  // omission goes unnoticed, and then breaks the moment a second Studio window (or
  // a second `StudioMCP` process) is connected. That makes it invisible in a
  // single-Studio test and certain in a real multi-window session - which is
  // exactly why it needs documenting rather than only validating.

  // requirement is per-SERVER, not per-tool: any place-scoped Roblox tool takes it.
